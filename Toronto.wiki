A relatively modern city, [[History of Toronto|Toronto's history]] dates back to the late 18th century, when its land was first [[Toronto Purchase|purchased by the British Crown]] from the [[Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation|Mississaugas of the New Credit]]. The settlement was later established as the [[York, Upper Canada|Town of York]] and proclaimed as the new capital of [[Upper Canada]] by its [[Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada|lieutenant governor]], [[John Graves Simcoe]]. In 1834, York was incorporated as a city and [[Name of Toronto|renamed]] to its present name. The city was ransacked in the [[Battle of York]] during the [[War of 1812]] and damaged in two great fires in [[Great Fire of Toronto (1849)|1849]] and in [[Great Fire of Toronto (1904)|1904]].

Reformist politician [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] became the first Mayor of Toronto and led the unsuccessful [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] of 1837 against the British colonial government. The city grew rapidly through the remainder of the 19th century, as a major destination for immigrants to Canada. The first significant population influx occurred when the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] brought a large number of Irish to the city, some of them transient and most of them Catholic. By 1851, the Irish-born population had become the largest single ethnic group in the city. Smaller numbers of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Irish immigrants were welcomed by the existing Scottish and English population, giving the [[Orange Order]] significant and long lasting influence over Toronto society. [[File:1TorontoFire1904.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Fire of Toronto (1904)|Great Toronto Fire of 1904]]]] Toronto was twice for brief periods the capital of the united [[Province of Canada]]: first from 1849 to 1852, following unrest in Montreal, and later 1856–1858 after which Quebec became capital until 1866 (one year before [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]); since then, the capital of Canada has remained [[Ottawa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/uca.html |title=Canada Provinces |publisher=Statoids.com |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref> As it had been for Upper Canada from 1793, Toronto became the capital of the province of Ontario after its official creation in 1867, the seat of government located at the Ontario Legislature located at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]]. Because of its provincial capital status, the city was also the location of [[Government House (Ontario)|Government House]], the residence of the [[viceroy|vice-regal]] representative of [[Monarchy of Canada|the Crown]] [[Monarchy in Ontario|in right of Ontario]]. In the 19th century, an extensive sewage system was built, and streets became illuminated with [[gas lighting]] as a regular service. Long-distance railway lines were constructed, including a route completed in 1854 linking Toronto with the Upper Great Lakes. The [[Grand Trunk Railway]] and the [[Northern Railway of Canada]] joined in the building of the first [[Original Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in downtown. The advent of the railway dramatically increased the numbers of immigrants arriving, commerce and industry, as had the Lake Ontario steamers and schooners entering port before which enabled Toronto to become a major gateway linking the world to the interior of the North American continent. [[File:Yonge Street crowd celebrating the end of the Boer War.jpg|thumb|left|Yonge Street in 1900]] Toronto became the largest alcohol distillation (in particular spirits) centre in North America; the [[Gooderham and Worts]] Distillery operations became the world's largest whiskey factory by the 1860s. A preserved section of this once dominant local industry remains in the [[Distillery District]], the harbour allowed for sure access of grain and sugar imports used in processing. Expanding port and rail facilities brought in Northern Timber for export and imported Pennsylvania coal, industry dominated the waterfront for the next 100 years. Horse-drawn [[streetcars]] gave way to electric streetcars in 1891, when the city granted the operation of the transit franchise to the [[Toronto Railway|Toronto Railway Company]]. The public transit system passed into public ownership in 1921 as the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]], later renamed the [[Toronto Transit Commission]]. The system now has the third-highest ridership of any city public transportation system in North America.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1122072619227_40/?hub=CTVNewsAt11 Toronto transit chief says searches unlikely] (2005).

The fire caused more than $10&nbsp;million in damage, and resulted in more stringent fire safety laws and expansion of the city's fire department. [[File:Toronto Harbour, 1919.jpg|thumb|right|[[Toronto Harbour]], 1919; [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] can be seen under construction]] The city received new immigrant groups beginning in the late 19th century into early 20th century, particularly Germans, French, Italians, and Jews from various parts of Eastern Europe. They were soon followed by Chinese, Russians, Poles and immigrants from other Eastern European nations, as the Irish before them, many of these new migrants lived in overcrowded shanty type slums, such as "[[The Ward, Toronto|the Ward]]" which was centred on [[Bay Street]], now the heart of the country's finances. Despite its fast paced growth, by the 1920s, Toronto's population and economic importance in Canada remained second to the much longer established [[Montreal]]. However, by 1934, the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] had become the largest in the country. ===Since 1945=== [[File:VE Day celebrations on Bay Street 1945.jpg|thumb|left|V-E Day celebrations on Bay Street, May 1945]] Following the Second World War refugees from war-torn Europe and Chinese job-seekers arrived, as well as construction labourers, particularly from Italy and Portugal. Following elimination of racially based immigration policies by the late 1960s, immigration began from all parts of the world. Toronto's population grew to more than one million in 1951 when large-scale suburbanization began, and doubled to two million by 1971. By the 1980s, Toronto had surpassed Montreal as Canada's most populous city and the chief economic hub. During this time, in part owing to the political uncertainty raised by the resurgence of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], many national and multinational corporations moved their head offices from Montreal to Toronto and [[Western Canada|Western Canadian]] cities.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3683/is_200201/ai_n9069631/pg_1 Westward ho?

In 1998, the metropolitan government was dissolved by the Provincial Government in the face of vigorous opposition from the smaller component municipalities and all six municipalities were [[Merger (politics)|amalgamated]] into a single municipality, creating the current City of Toronto, with [[Mel Lastman]] as its first mayor (after being mayor of North York).

It has a {{convert|46|km|mi|0|adj=on}} long [[Toronto waterfront|waterfront]] shoreline, on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario. The [[Toronto Islands]] and [[Port Lands]] extend out into the lake, allowing for a somewhat sheltered [[Toronto Harbour]] south of the downtown core.<ref name="northwest">{{cite web |url=http://www.toronto.ca/attractions/getting_here.htm |title=Getting Here |work=Visiting Toronto |publisher=City of Toronto |accessdate=February 14, 2008}}</ref> The city's borders are formed by [[Lake Ontario]] to the south, [[Etobicoke Creek]] and [[Ontario Highway 427|Highway 427]] to the west, [[Steeles Avenue]] to the north and the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] and the Scarborough-Pickering Townline to the east. ===Topography=== The city is intersected by three rivers and numerous tributaries: the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]] in the west end and the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] east of downtown at opposite ends of the [[Toronto Harbour]], and the Rouge River at the city's eastern limits. The harbour was naturally created by sediment build-up from lake currents that created the [[Toronto Islands]]. The many creeks and rivers cutting from north toward the lake created large tracts of densely forested [[Toronto ravine system|ravines]], and provide ideal sites for parks and recreational trails. However, the ravines also interfere with the city's [[grid plan]], and this results in major thoroughfares such as [[Finch Avenue]], [[Leslie Street]], [[Lawrence Avenue]], and [[St. Clair Avenue]] terminating on one side of ravines and continuing on the other side. Other thoroughfares such as the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]] are required to span above the ravines. These deep ravines prove useful for draining the city's storm sewer system during heavy rains, but some sections, particularly near the Don River are prone to sudden, heavy floods. During the [[last glacial period|last ice age]], the lower part of Toronto was beneath [[Glacial Lake Iroquois]]. Today, a series of [[escarpment]]s mark the lake's former boundary, known as the ''Iroquois Shoreline''. The escarpments are most prominent from [[Victoria Park Avenue]] to the mouth of [[Highland Creek (Toronto)|Highland Creek]], where they form the [[Scarborough Bluffs]]. Other observable sections include the area near St. Clair Avenue West between [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]] and the Don River, and north of [[Davenport Road]] from Caledonia to [[Spadina Avenue|Spadina Road]]; the [[Casa Loma]] grounds sit above this escarpment. Despite its deep ravines, Toronto is not remarkably hilly, but does increase in elevation steadily away from the lake. Elevation differences range from {{convert|75|m|ft|0}} above-sea-level at the Lake Ontario shore to {{convert|209|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} ASL near the [[York University]] grounds in the city's north end at the intersection of [[Keele Street]] and [[Steeles Avenue]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toronto.ca/toronto_facts/geography.htm |title=City of Toronto: Toronto Facts, Toronto's geography |publisher=Toronto.ca |date=October 23, 2000 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}</ref> There are occasional hilly areas, in particular [[Midtown, Toronto|midtown Toronto]] has a number of rolling hills. Lake Ontario remains occasionally visible from the peaks of these ridges as far north as [[Eglinton Avenue]], {{convert|7|to|8|km|mi}} inland. Much of the current lakeshore land area fronting the Toronto Harbour is artificial landfill filled during the late 19th century. Until then, the lakefront docks (then known as wharves) were set back further inland than today. Much of the adjacent [[Port Lands]] are also fill. The Toronto Islands were a natural landspit until a storm in 1858 severed their connection to the mainland, creating a channel later used by shipping interests to access the docks. ===Climate=== Toronto has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa/Dfb''), with warm, humid summers and cold winters. The city experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in day to day temperature, particularly during the colder weather season. Owing to urbanization and its proximity to water, Toronto has a fairly low diurnal temperature range (day-night temperature difference). The denser urban scape makes for warmer nights year around and is not as cold throughout the winter than surrounding areas (particularly north of the city); however, it can be noticeably cooler on many spring and early summer afternoons under the influence of a lake breeze. Other low-scale maritime effects on the climate include [[lake-effect snow]], fog and delaying of spring- and fall-like conditions, known as [[seasonal lag]]. Toronto winters sometimes feature short cold snaps where maximum temperatures remain below {{convert|-10|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, often made to feel colder by [[wind chill]]. Snowstorms, sometimes mixed with ice and rain can disrupt work and travel schedules, accumulating snow can fall any time from November until mid-April. However, mild stretches with temperatures in the {{convert|5|to|12|C|F}} range and infrequently higher also occur in most winters melting accumulated snow. The summer months are characterized by long stretches of humid weather. Usually in the range from {{convert|23|C|F|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|31|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, daytime temperatures occasionally surpass {{convert|35|C|F|0|abbr=on}} accompanied by high humidity making it feel oppressive during these brief periods of hot weather. Spring and autumn are transitional seasons with generally mild or cool temperatures with alternating dry and wet periods. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, but summer is usually the wettest season, the bulk falling during thunderstorms.

[[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian-era]] residential buildings can be found in enclaves such as [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]], [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]], [[The Annex]], and [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]]. [[Wychwood Park]] is historically significant for the architecture of its homes, and for being one of Toronto's earliest planned communities. The Wychwood Park neighbourhood was designated as an Ontario Heritage Conservation district in 1985. The [[Casa Loma (neighbourhood)|Casa Loma]] neighbourhood is named after [[Casa Loma]], a storybook castle built in 1911 complete with gardens, turrets, stables, an elevator, secret passages, and a bowling alley. [[Spadina House]] is a 19th century [[manor house|manor]] that is now a museum. The City of Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by six separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres. Former municipalities include [[East York]], [[Etobicoke]], [[North York]], [[Old Toronto]], [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]], and [[York, Ontario|York]]. ====Old Toronto==== [[File:Toronto map.png|thumb|300px|Left|Map of Toronto with major traffic routes. Also shown are the boundaries of [[Metropolitan Toronto|six former municipalities]], which form the current City of Toronto.]] The [[Old Toronto|Old City of Toronto]] covers the area generally known as [[Downtown Toronto|downtown]], but also older neighbourhoods to the east, west, and north of downtown. It includes the historic core of Toronto and remains the most densely populated part of the city. The [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] contains the [[First Canadian Place]], [[Toronto-Dominion Centre]], [[Scotia Plaza]], [[Royal Bank Plaza]], [[Commerce Court]] and [[Brookfield Place]]. This area includes, among others, the neighbourhoods of St. James (not to be confused with St. James Town to the north), [[Garden District, Toronto|Garden District]], [[St. Lawrence, Toronto|St. Lawrence]], [[Corktown, Toronto|Corktown]], and [[Church and Wellesley]]. From that point, the Toronto skyline extends northward along Yonge Street. Old Toronto is also home to many historically wealthy residential enclaves, such as [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]], [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]], [[The Annex]], [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]], [[Lytton Park]], [[Deer Park, Toronto|Deer Park]], [[Moore Park, Toronto|Moore Park]], and [[Casa Loma (neighbourhood)|Casa Loma]], most stretching away from downtown to the north. East and west of Downtown, neighbourhoods such as [[Kensington Market]], [[Chinatown, Toronto|Chinatown]], [[Leslieville]], [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]] and [[Riverdale, Toronto|Riverdale]] are home to bustling commercial and cultural areas as well as communities of artists with studio lofts, with many middle and upper class professionals. Other neighbourhoods in the central city retain an ethnic identity, including two [[Chinatown, Toronto|Chinatowns]], the [[Greektown, Toronto|Greektown]] area, [[Little Italy, Toronto|Little Italy]], [[Trinity–Bellwoods|Portugal Village]], and [[Gerrard Street (Toronto)|Little India]], along with others. ====Suburbs==== The inner suburbs are contained within the former municipalities of [[York, Ontario|York]] and [[East York]]. These are mature and traditionally working class areas, primarily consisting of post–World War I small, single-family homes and small apartment blocks. Neighbourhoods such as [[Crescent Town]], [[Thorncliffe Park]], [[Weston, Ontario|Weston]], and [[Oakwood–Vaughan]] mainly consist of high-rise apartments, which are home to many new immigrant families. During the 2000s, many neighbourhoods have become ethnically diverse and have undergone [[gentrification]], as a result of increasing population and a housing boom during the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century. The first neighbourhoods affected were [[Leaside]] and [[North Toronto]], gradually progressing into the western neighbourhoods in York. Some of the area's housing is in the process of being replaced or remodelled. The outer suburbs comprising the former municipalities of [[Etobicoke]] (west), [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]] (east) and [[North York]] (north) largely retain the [[grid plan]] laid before post-war development. Sections were long established and quickly growing towns before the suburban housing boom began and the emergence of Metro Government, existing towns or villages such as [[Mimico]], [[Islington, Ontario|Islington]] and [[New Toronto]] in Etobicoke; [[Willowdale, Ontario|Willowdale]], [[Newtonbrook]] and [[Downsview]] in North York; [[Agincourt, Toronto|Agincourt]], [[Wexford, Toronto|Wexford]] and [[West Hill, Toronto|West Hill]] in Scarborough where suburban development boomed around or between these and other towns beginning in the late 1940s. Upscale neighbourhoods were built such as the [[Bridle Path, Toronto|Bridle Path]] in North York, the area surrounding the Scarborough Bluffs in [[Guildwood]], and most of central Etobicoke, such as [[Humber Valley Village]], and [[The Kingsway]]. One of largest and earliest "planned communities" was [[Don Mills]], parts of which were first built in the 1950s.<ref>"Plan town of 45,000 on Don Mills farms; Will cost 00,000,000", Paul L. Fox, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', March 12, 1953, p. 3. Retrieved on May 2, 2007.</ref> Phased development mixing single-detached housing with higher density apartment blocks became more popular as a suburban model of development. Over the late 20th century and early 21st century, [[North York Centre|North York City Centre]], [[Islington-City Centre West|Etobicoke City Centre]] and [[Scarborough City Centre]] have emerged as secondary business districts outside Downtown Toronto. High-rise development in these areas have given the former municipalities distinguishable skylines of their own with high-density transit corridors serving them. ===Industrial=== [[File:HPIM1243.jpg|thumb|The [[Distillery District]]]] In the earlier industrial era of Toronto, industry became concentrated along the [[Toronto Harbour]] and lower [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] mouth. The [[Distillery District]] contains the largest and best-preserved collection of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] industrial architecture in North America. Once an alcohol processing centre, related structures along the Harbour include the Canada Malting Co. grain processing towers and the [[Redpath Sugar Refinery]]. Although production of spirits has declined over the decades, Toronto still has a growing [[microbrewery]] industry. The District is a national heritage site, it was listed by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine as a "top pick" in Canada for travellers. Similar areas that still retain their post-industrial character, but are now largely residential are the [[Fashion District, Toronto|Fashion District]], [[Corktown, Toronto|Corktown]], and parts of [[Riverdale, Toronto|South Riverdale]] and [[Leslieville]]. Toronto still has some active older industrial areas, such as [[Brockton Village]], [[Mimico]] and [[New Toronto]]. In the west end of Old Toronto and York, the [[Weston, Ontario|Weston]]/[[Mount Dennis]] and [[The Junction|Junction]] areas still contain factories, meat packing facilities and railyards close to medium density residential. Beginning in the late 19th century as Toronto sprawled out, industrial areas were set up on the outskirts. Over time, pockets of industrial land mostly followed rail lines and later highway corridors as the city grew outwards. This trend continues to this day, the largest factories and distribution warehouses have mostly moved to the suburban environs of [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel]] and [[Regional Municipality of York|York]] Regions; but also within the current city: Etobicoke (concentrated around [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Pearson Airport]]), North York, and Scarborough. Many of Toronto's [[Brownfield land|former industrial sites]] close to (or in) Downtown have been redeveloped including parts of the [[Toronto waterfront]] and [[Liberty Village]], large-scale development is underway in the [[West Don Lands]]. The still mostly vacated [[Port Lands]] remain largely undeveloped, apart from a [[Portlands Energy Centre|power plant]], a shipping container facility and out-of-commission industrial facilities. There are future plans for development, including residential areas under the guidance of [[Waterfront Toronto]]. ===Public spaces=== {{See also|List of Toronto parks}} [[File:Toronto Yellow Circles 2010.jpg|thumb|right|High Park in Toronto, with [[Menashe Kadishman]]'s ''Yellow Circles'' (1967)]] Toronto has a diverse array of public spaces, from city squares to public parks overlooking [[Toronto ravine system|ravines]]. A group called the [[Toronto Public Space Committee]] was formed to protect the city's public spaces. [[Nathan Phillips Square]] is the city's main square in downtown, and forms the entrance to [[Toronto City Hall|City Hall]]. [[Yonge-Dundas Square]], a newer, privately owned square near to City Hall, has also gained attention in recent years as one of the busiest gathering spots in the city. Other squares include [[Harbourfront Centre|Harbourfront Square]], on the revitalized [[Toronto waterfront]], and the civic squares at the former city halls of the defunct Metropolitan Toronto, most notably [[Mel Lastman Square]] in North York. There are many large downtown parks, which include [[Grange Park (Toronto)|Grange Park]], [[Moss Park]], [[Allan Gardens]], [[Little Norway Park]], [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]], [[Riverdale Park (Toronto)|Riverdale Park]], [[Trinity Bellwoods Park]], [[Christie Pits Park|Christie Pits]], and the [[Leslie Street Spit]], which mainly consists of Tommy Thompson Park and opens on weekends. The [[Toronto Islands]] have several acres of park space, accessible from downtown by ferry. Large parks in the outer areas include [[High Park]], [[Humber Bay Park]], [[Centennial Park (Toronto)|Centennial Park]], [[Downsview Park]], [[Guild Inn|Guildwood Park]], and [[Rouge Park]]. An almost hidden park is the compact [[Cloud Gardens]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lostrivers.ca/points/cloudgrdnpk.htm |title = Urban Design: Cloud Garden Park |work=Lost Streams, Toronto, Web site |accessdate =March 27, 2009 }}</ref> which has both open areas and a glassed-in greenhouse in downtown Toronto. Nathan Phillips Square, Harbourfront Centre, and Mel Lastman Square feature popular rinks for public ice-skating. Etobicoke's Colonel Sam Smith Trail opened in 2011 and is Toronto's first skating trail. Centennial Park and [[North York Ski Centre|Earl Bales Park]] offer outdoor skiing and snowboarding slopes with a chair lift, rental facilities, and lessons. [[Nathan Phillips Square]] is undergoing a major redesign by PLANT Architect Inc., [[Shore Tilbe Irwin + Partners]], Peter Lindsay Schaudt Landscape Architecture Inc., and Adrian Blackwell (winners of the international design competition in 2007). West 8, a Dutch architecture firm, won the Central Waterfront Innovative Design Competition in 2006 to redesign the central part of the [[Toronto waterfront]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.toronto.ca/waterfront/newsrel060206.htm |title = West 8 Wins Waterfront Corp.
